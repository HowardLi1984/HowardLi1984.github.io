Hi there! I am Hao Li (李昊 in Chinese), a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the School of Comupter Science at Peking University, advised by Prof. Li Yuan. Prior to that, I get my Bachelor of Science degree in computer science at Peking University with a Summa Cum Laude.

My research interests include multimodality Learning, visual understanding, and AI for Chemical Science. I have published more than 20 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y4va91AAAAAJ'> Google Scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>300+</span></strong></a>.
